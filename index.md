## About
Contemporary algorithms and tools for time series management predominantly handle univariate time series. However, modern data sources frequently generate richer, multivariate time series. Examples include modern sensors that monitor multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., temperature, wind, and rainfall), finance time series (bid and ask price, along with volume), and data from specialized scientific and medical apparatus.
Despite the necessity, currently only very few algorithms address the management, analysis, and extraction of insights from such multivariate data. 
Moreover, existing work is tailored to specific needs. 
Foundational functionalities that have propelled advancements in univariate time series analysis, such as indexing for similarity search and detection of motifs, cannot be trivially extended to the multivariate case. 
This limitation significantly restricts the efficiency and/or effectiveness of existing efforts for the analysis of multivariate time series, for several analysis tasks. 

This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners working with multivariate time series, for presenting and discussing requirements, open problems, and related work, and to foster collaborations and further developments in the topic. Industry will participate for presenting problems, requirements, and current approaches, and to reach out to the ICDE community. Researchers will present their novel and ongoing work on the topic. The full-day workshop will include: 
(a) 8 paper presentations, 
(b) four invited talks from industry experts and domain experts, 
(c) panel discussion, and time for exchanging ideas and for fostering collaborations. 

The proceedings of the workshop will be published alongside with the conference proceedings.

## Topics of interest
The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Open challenges in multivariate time series management
- Similarity search on multivariate time series, and detection of multivariate correlations and similarity measures
- Online analytical processing for multivariate time series 
- Streaming and/or distributed analytics on multivariate time series
- Storing, indexing, and querying multivariate time series
- Sketching and summarizing multivariate time series
- Data preparation (data cleaning, noise removal, handling missing values) on multivariate time series
- Forecasting and anomaly detection for multivariate time series
- Machine learning and deep learning techniques for multivariate time series
- Interactive visualization and analytics on (streaming) multivariate time series
- Handling uncertainty
- Privacy-preserving analytics on multivariate data
- Requirements, applications, and query languages for multivariate time series analytics

## Submission Guidelines
The workshop will accept regular papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references) and short papers describing work in progress, demos, vision/outrageous ideas (up to 4 pages, excluding references). All submissions must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE template available [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
